# Addressing the question of establishing multiple conditions at once for the if_else statement

df2 <- df %>%
  mutate(bloodpress = if_else(sbp < 100 & survival == “Alive”, “hypotensive”, “okay”), missing = NULL)

# This code will evaluate the condition of sbp < 100 AND survival == "Alive" simultaneously
# If both are satisfied, it will assign "hypotensive" to `bloodpress`
# If either one is not satisfied, it will assign "okay" to `bloodpress`

df2 <- df %>%
  mutate(bloodpress = if_else(sbp < 100 | survival == “Alive”, “hypotensive”, “okay”), missing = NULL)

# This code uses the same conditions but with an OR operator |
# If sbp < 100 or survival == "Alive", then `bloodpress` will be assigned "hypotensive"
# If both conditions are not satisfied, then `bloodpress` will be assigned "okay"
